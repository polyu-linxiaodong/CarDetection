# Vehicle Detection Project

This project implements vehicle detection using Faster R-CNN and YOLO algorithms. It analyzes and compares the impact of different algorithms on vehicle recognition.

## Project Structure

- **FasterRCNN**: Vehicle detection using the Faster R-CNN algorithm.
- **YOLO**: Vehicle detection using the YOLO algorithm.
- **models**: Contains the trained models.
- **Show**: Displays the detection results.

## Results Display

To view the detection results and compare the performance of the two algorithms, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `Show` directory:
    ```sh
    cd Show
    ```
2. Run the Streamlit application:
    ```sh
    streamlit run show.py
    ```
3. Upload an image in the Streamlit interface to see the detection results and compare the effectiveness of the two algorithms.

## Training Process

1. **Dataset Preparation**: Use the dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Dataset Preprocessing**: Preprocess the dataset according to the requirements of each algorithm.
3. **Model Training**: Train the models using Faster R-CNN and YOLO algorithms.
4. **Model Evaluation and Display**: Evaluate the models and display the results using Faster R-CNN and YOLO.
